# Linear Regression: The Classic Machine Learning Algorithm You Need to Know

Examples in R, Python, and Excel to perform simple linear regression on Meta (Facebook) ad data.

## Description

This repository contains the dataset and code examples to go along with my blog post about linear regression using Meta (Facebook) ad data. You can read the complete post at [https://blog.marketingdatascience.ai](https://medium.com/@marketingdatascience/linear-regression-the-classic-machine-learning-algorithm-you-need-to-know-1fe0b48b06a3). The dataset comes from one of my clients who ran a Facebook campaign in the summer of 2024 in order to promote online sales on their website. In this example, we're just going to focus on establishing a correlation between impressions and clicks.

## Getting Started

I'm going to assume you're already familiar with R, Python, or Excel so just pick which one you want to use. I used R Studio for R, VS Code for Python, and Microsoft Excel for Mac to prepare the code examples. The blog post explains more about the dependencies for each, which are minimal.
